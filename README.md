# Information:

In this project, the Class Diagram, Database Model, and Website Pages were first constructed in the file Shows4All.drawio (If using dark mode, please open on the website: draw.io). After planning this architecture, the application was built according to it.

# Model Used:

In this project, I adopted the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern as the basis for my ASP.NET application:

View: My views are implemented as Razor Pages, which reside in HTML classes. For example, you can check the file SerieInfo.cshtml.

ViewModel: The ViewModel components of my application are represented by my C# classes, such as SerieInfo.cshtml.cs. These classes facilitate communication between my views and the underlying data.

Model: My models serve as templates for various classes in my project. They provide the necessary structure for the database to store information and allow me to retrieve the data needed to construct these classes. You can find these model classes in the 'Models' directory."
